# Utility class to run requests against a WSO2 API.
# It will automatically renew the token if it doesn't work.  The
# public entry points are:

# Constructor: initialize(api_prefix, key, secret, token_server, token="Toker")
# Initialize the class with the api prefix which will be prepended to
# every request.  The prefix may just point to the gateway or may
# point to a specific API.
# The constructor also requires the key, secret and token server API.
# You may pass a specific token but this is not required since the
# class will automatically try to renew the token if it finds a request fails.

# get_request(string): This string will be appended to the api_prefix and
# executed as a GET


class WAPI

  # key and secret are oauth key and secret for generating tokens.
  # token_server is full url for request to generate / renew tokens.
  #
  # api_prefix is string that will be prefixed to every request make
  # through this instance.  It will contain host and may anything else
  # that will appear in front of every request.  E.g. It might contain
  # https://woodpigeon.dsc.umich.edu:8243/StudentDashboard/v1 or just
  # https://woodpigeon.dsc.umich.edu:8243 depending on how you choose
  # to use it.
